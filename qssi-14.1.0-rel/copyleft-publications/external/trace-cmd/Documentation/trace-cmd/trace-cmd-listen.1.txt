TRACE-CMD-LISTEN(1)
===================

NAME
----
trace-cmd-listen - listen for incoming connection to record tracing.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd listen* -p 'port' ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) listen sets up a port to listen to waiting for connections
from other hosts that run 'trace-cmd-record(1)' with the *-N* option. When a
connection is made, and the remote host sends data, it will create a file
called 'trace.HOST:PORT.dat'. Where HOST is the name of the remote host, and
PORT is the port that the remote host used to connect with.

OPTIONS
-------
*-p* 'port'::
    This option will specify the port to listen to.

*-D*::
    This options causes trace-cmd listen to go into a daemon mode and run in
    the background.

*-V*::
    Listen on a vsocket instead. This is useful for tracing between host and
    guest VMs.

*-d* 'dir'::
    This option specifies a directory to write the data files into.

*-o* 'filename'::
    This option overrides the default 'trace' in the 'trace.HOST:PORT.dat' that
    is created when a remote host connects.

*-l* 'filename'::
    This option writes the output messages to a log file instead of standard output.

*--verbose*[='level']::
     Set the log level. Supported log levels are "none", "critical", "error", "warning",
     "info", "debug", "all" or their identifiers "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6". Setting the log
     level to specific value enables all logs from that and all previous levels.
     The level will default to "info" if one is not specified.

     Example: enable all critical, error and warning logs

      trace-cmd listen --verbose=warning
