TRACE-CMD-AGENT(1)
==================

NAME
----
trace-cmd-agent - Run as an agent on a machine (to be controlled by another machine)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd agent* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) agent listens over a vsocket (for virtual machines) or a TCP port
for connections to control the tracing of the machine. The agent will then start
tracing on the local machine and pass the data to the controlling connection.

OPTIONS
-------
*-N* 'client'::
    Listen over TCP instead of a vsocket. Must pass in a client host name or IP address
    to allow connection to. It will only connect to the specified client. Note, any process
    on that client can control the agent.

    *This is a very insecure setting. Only use on a trusted network*
    *Only use if the client machine is totally trusted*

*-p* 'port'::
    This option will specify the port to listen to.

*-D*::
    This options causes trace-cmd agent to go into a daemon mode and run in
    the background.

*--verbose*[='level']::
     Set the log level. Supported log levels are "none", "critical", "error", "warning",
     "info", "debug", "all" or their identifiers "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6". Setting the log
     level to specific value enables all logs from that and all previous levels.
     The level will default to "info" if one is not specified.

     Example: enable all critical, error and warning logs

      trace-cmd listen --verbose=warning
