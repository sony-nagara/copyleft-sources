Unit tests for trace-cmd libraries. The tests use CUnit framework:
 http://cunit.sourceforge.net/
which must be pre installed on the system, before building the unit tests.
The framework can be downloaded, compiled and installed manually, or
using a precompiled distro package:

 Fedora:
	 CUnit
	 CUnit-devel

 Ubuntu and Debian:
	libcunit1
	libcunit1-doc
	libcunit1-dev
